The following task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to deliver readable, maintainable and testable code. As an agile organization, we are applying equal emphasis on assessing both your problem solving and testing abilities.
Be prepared to present your solution over conversation that will lead to questions around design decisions, rationale and future expansion.
The exercise is to demo your technical skills and takes most candidates a few hours; please don’t spend a huge amount of time making it perfect.
• Please complete the following task with the language and libraries you feel comfortable with.

Instructions: Complete the steps in order. At each step build the simplest possible solution which meets the requirement. Tag and git commit after each step so that your approach is clear.

Step 1: Build an Orders Service
